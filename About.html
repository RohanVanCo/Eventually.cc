            <h1>ABOUT EVENTUALLY</h1>
            <p>The “Eventually” app was made with the idea that such an application would make reserving
                and getting concert tickets much more easy and accessible. Its goal is to make a user-friendly
                application to self-book local concert tickets for people who do not have the time nor the patience
                to wait in line to buy concert tickets. “Eventually” is also made in mind for those who are hosting their
                own concerts and these people looking for something to make their tickets be digital and is willing to
                collaborate with programmers to make their concert be on the spotlight while also making it easier to
                organize the attendee limit, premium members, and the date and time of the concert they are hosting.
